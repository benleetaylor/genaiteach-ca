This is the future home of our Generative AI and Assessment (GAIA) repository, which will include sample assessments submitted by study participants. All assessments will be licensed under a [Creative Commons Public Domain License (CC0 1.0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/){:target="_blank"} in the ethos of open educational resources (OER).

We intend to begin adding assessments toward the end of 2023.
