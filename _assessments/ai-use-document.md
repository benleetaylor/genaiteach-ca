description:  I selected the field that seemed most relevant, though students are not required to use generative AI. The document I am submitting ("AI Use Document") is an instructional document for students who choose to use generative AI in certain course projects deemed to be quite vulnerable to AI use (a presentation and a final). If a student chooses to use generative AI in either of these assessments, they must complete an ungraded supplementary AI Use Document and submit this with their work. The function (for students) is to promote critical and responsible use of AI in their learning and (for me) to try to ensure that students are being graded on their own work and comprehension. The AI Use Document is experimental, and not overly prescribed. It is also ungraded. As yet, I don't want to dissuade use of this document by making it another graded component. I also want students to be able to complete this document for the many types and tasks to which AI may be directed.

University Policy: any unauthorized use of ChatGPT (or other AI tools)
on assessments is considered to be a breach of academic honesty.

In this course, you are permitted to use AI as much as you want, on any
assessed components unless stated otherwise. **However, AI should be
used to compliment and improve your work, rather than as a substitute
for doing your own work. If your use of AI diminishes the quality of
work or your effort, this can result in penalties. If you are unsure of
whether you should use AI, talk to me, or don't use it at all!**

If you use AI to create your Presentation or in your Final, you must
complete an AI Use Document and submit this document with your
Presentation/Final.

* Identify the tool(s) you used.
	- Example: *While working on my presentation, I used ChatGPT and DeepAI.*
* Briefly identify where you used AI in your Presentation/Final
    (include all uses).
    - For example, if you used ChatGPT to help with your research, identify the parts of your presentation where ChatGPT was used.
    - You don't have to give an account of every single query, but
        supposing you used ChatGPT for research on Galileo you might
        indicate what parts of the research.
        - Example: *I used ChatGPT to learn basics about Galileo's
            education and make a timeline of his publications.*
        - Example: *I used DeepAI to generate 5 images for my
            presentation.*
* Describe your method of tool use for each task.
	- You may use AI to help with various kinds of tasks (initial
        topic exploration, research question formation, research,
        drafting and editing, etc.). You should provide an account of
        the method you used when performing any such task.
    - **Your method should be suitable to the task!**
		- If you are using something like ChatGPT to help with
            research, you should use an appropriate method.
        - You may want to research suitable methods!
    - Example: *While using ChatGPT to help with research, I had
        already done enough research to know what information I needed.
        Then, I typically progressed through the following steps:*
        - *Instruct ChatGPT of its role as a researcher.*
        -   *Provide a precise question to get to the exact information
            I am after.*
        -   *Based on response, engage in refining and clarifying
            questions/conversation.*
        -   *Then verify new information with reliable sources.*
*   If the AI tool (such as ChatGPT) maintains a log of your inputs,
    **provide me with that log**. This can be a document or a
    link.

This is the first time this AI use document is being used, so this is an
experiment of sorts. This does not have to be a long document,
especially if AI was used only in limited ways. However, if AI was used
in substantial ways, this may warrant thorough descriptions. I may ask
for clarification if the information is inadequate.

**This document will not be graded. However, I will use the information
you provide to infer whether your use of AI is responsible and
effective, and this may influence your grade.** Irresponsible use might
include using AI to do all the work for your rather than using AI as a
tool to help you do better work. Ineffective use might include using AI
with a method that does not fit the task.

If AI was used and this document is not completed or completed
inadequately, grades may be deducted, a grade of 0 may be given, or
academic integrity escalation may be required.
