### Ethical Leadership Group Presentation (15 minutes)

In his article Developing and Sustaining an Ethical Corporate Culture: the core elements, Schwartz outlines six core ethical values that drive leader's behaviour during ethical decisions. For this assignment your group will choose one of the values and present an ethical leadership dilemma that relates to a business decision. The decision could be about staff, suppliers, government regulations or community members. You are encouraged to use Chat GPT to develop the dilemma, and potential examples of leadership behaviour related to that value. Then, use your critical thinking skills to apply leadership experiences you have had, or learned about to show how the leader addresses the situation.

Your presentation should include:

-   Introduction to the team and topic
-   Definition/explanation of the value on which you are presenting
-   An ethical leadership dilemma related to the value in a business
    setting
-   Explanation or demonstration of how the value relates to at least
    two leadership characteristics
-   Summary/conclusion
