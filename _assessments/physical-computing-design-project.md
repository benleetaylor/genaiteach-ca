### Introduction

For the final project I would like you to work either individually or in
a group of up to 3 to create a proof-of-concept physical computing
prototype.  This involves building a connected object which promotes
digital learning, collects data and/or exerts control a biology,
environmental or health situation, broadly interpreted.  The ESP32 is
suggested as a primary component, since they are cheap, you will be
familiar with them from the guided practical labs, and they have SOOOO
much capability, particularly: interfacing them with your smartphone.

To build your project you may use any hardware or software from the
guided tutorials, and as necessary, your group may spend up to \$65 per
person (since there\'s no textbook for the course) as I mentioned in the
syllabus and the approved fee for digital materials. If you do buy
equipment it\'s probably best to visit a store or order by November 18
since shipping takes time.  It\'s also a good idea to review your idea
with the instructional staff to ensure the parts work in the way you are
thinking, e.g. you decide to order a 5V sensor but the ESP is a 3.3V
device so when the sensor arrives but it won\'t work.  It doesn\'t hurt
to have a backup plan you can pivot to, if the hardware falls short. 
You may use Generative AI tools in the development of the software in
the sense this project is about discovery learning from online sources.
Your success in mastering a difficult programming language (C) will be a
parameter of success, but mainly the challenge is about group problem
solving in the twenty-first century. Acknowledge any sources or aids as
we have previously discussed in class.

### Submitted Work

The final submission will consist of a presentation and a reflective
paper.  

For groups the presentation will be in common. In the presentation you
will explain, discuss and demonstrate the prototype in 10 minutes or
less. There\'s often more to learn from failing than succeeding,
however, it would be great if you succeeded to demonstrate aspects of
the functionality of your system design as well as discuss design
concepts from the course.

For the paper each person will provide their own reflective writing
about the design process, and experience with discovery based learning. 
The report/paper explains how your rapid prototype works/worked and also
how the discovery based learning project worked out.  It is written from
your perspective, but referring to your design experiences and concepts
from readings from the course, especially the second half. You may
collaborate on illustrations with other members of the group.

### Deadline

For the presentation you may either present live to the class on
November 29 during regular class hours, or make a recorded video
presentation and submit it for review by November 29 at 11pm using Zoom.

I strongly suggest you submit your reflective paper also on the last day
of classes, in order to use your study break to prepare for exams, but I
have made it actually due by Thursday, November 30 at 5pm, for those
last minute people.

### Guiding Questions

You may consider revisiting these questions, from the previous
assignment where you and how they apply to the prototype you *did*
build.
- What direct problems might the proposed system solve? (what will we
learn from it)
- What *did* you need to build it?
- What antecedent or similar systems exist and how is this the same or
different?
- How might it connect with and change other digital, social or
political systems?
- What sources and help did you use to develop the project (friends,
relatives, group members, blogs, Youtube, manufacturer forums,
Generative AI, etc.)

### Weighting

The presentation represents 10% of your grade.

The reflective paper represents 25% of your grade. I\'m looking for 6-8
pages, double spaced.  If you are in a group you may share
illustrations.  *Note some additional suggestions at the reflective
paper submit-link.*

Some students may wish to browse each other\'s projects, so if you made
a video and would like to share it please indicate this in the comments
field.
