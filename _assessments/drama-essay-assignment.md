### Essay, purpose/skills

-   English courses develop skills that are useful in a wide range of
    careers: most importantly 1) writing clearly and concisely---in a
    world of tl:dr, we need effective communication! but also 2)
    critical thinking---the ability to find information and assess its
    accuracy/value, 3) writing persuasively---the ability to affect how
    people feel and respond, and 4) creative thinking---the ability to
    produce something new and improved in a world more and more
    dominated by bland copy-paste algorithmic writing.

-   The essay for this course gives you practice in developing all these
    skills! You will be finding and assessing information about
    socio-historical contexts, presenting it clearly and concisely, and
    persuading readers that your creative way to reflect that
    information in performance will have artistic value.

### Essay, details

-   Write an essay focused on one of the five assigned course plays
    other than "The Rehearsal." Aim for under 1500 words---quality is
    more important than quantity. Please ignore the "five-paragraph
    essay" plan much beloved by high school teachers---split your essay
    into paragraphs that cover one major topic each, and suit your
    structure to your argument, not your argument to your structure!

-   Find a culturally significant moment in your focus play, and
    research its socio-historical context. It could be one specific line
    or action, or a slightly longer but still brief dialogue/incident.
    When researching, look for peer-reviewed academic sources either
    from our library (books, articles) or respectable and reliable
    websites (academic blogs, OwnVoices organizations). Aim for 3-5
    sources you can draw on in the essay: if you can only find one or
    two, you should get help with your research or choose a different
    moment in the play; if you can find ten or twelve, choose the best
    ones to use as support in the essay.

-   The purpose of the essay is twofold: 1) explain the context of this
    moment in the play with support from your secondary sources (your
    research), to deepen your readers' understanding of the play, and 2)
    suggest how to incorporate this new understanding of the play
    through staging, to strengthen the impact it would have on a live
    audience, using your primary source (the play script) as support.

-   Your staging suggestion(s) need to have clear links to your research
    and to the play's content/message, but don't have to be limited to
    the moment you focused your research on. For example, adding details
    to a character's costume or the set design would be visible
    throughout the play or the scene, but can add to the audience's
    understanding of your focus moment. Staging suggestions are not of
    course limited to costume and set---you could use a prop, a
    soundscape, lighting effects, blocking, etc.

-   Note: if you choose *Fiddler on the Roof* for your essay, you'll
    also need to watch your focus scene in multiple video versions (the
    film version and different ones on YouTube) and compare your staging
    suggestion to what other productions have done as part of your
    essay. Add the productions you watch to your Works Cited list, along
    with your research sources and the primary source (the play).

-   The final paragraph of the essay should **not** repeat your previous
    points about cultural context and staging. Instead, address the "so
    what?" questions: How would your hypothetical live audience benefit
    from your staging? What will they learn, and why should they learn
    that?

-   The finished paper should respond to feedback you've received on the
    introductory paragraph (from your TL), the outline (from your
    peers), and the rough draft (from your TL).

-   It must include a Works Cited list (or a Works Cited and Consulted
    list), giving your primary text, your secondary sources, and, if you
    focused on *Fiddler on the Roof*, the video versions you watched to
    see how others staged your focus scene.

-   It should also include an Assistance Acknowledged list in a short
    paragraph, thanking the people/apps that helped you. For example,
    you might say "I'd like to thank the library staff person at AskAway
    who helped me find the article by Chung, Manpreet in my tutorial for
    suggesting the lighting cue, and my mother for proofreading the
    paper. I also acknowledge that I used ChatGPT to generate possible
    titles for this paper, and I adapted its suggestion of 'blah blah
    blah' to my current title of 'blah blah.'"

 Stage 1a, introductory paragraph (handed in for feedback)

-   This is an early draft of the first paragraph of your essay, due Jan
    26: it needs to map out what your paper will do. However, because
    it's an early draft, you're not locked into this for the final
    essay---in fact, you'll **want** to revise it in response to a)
    feedback from your TL, b) feedback you get from your peers on your
    outline, and c) your own writing process!

-   It needs to be clear and concise: don't repeat yourself, add
    unnecessary words, or try to make yourself sound fancy.

-   The essay for this course is **not** an argumentative essay, so
    it **won't **have a thesis statement! It's more an expository essay,
    i.e. one that provides an explanation to your readers: in this case,
    you're explaining the context for something in the play and then
    explaining how you personally would make that context clear to a
    theatre audience.

### Stage 3, final draft (handed in for a mark)

-   The revised draft of your essay is due Mar 1. Check the description
    of the essay details above to make sure you're including everything
    you need to.

-   Your tutorial leader will read this version over and use the same
    assessment criteria as for the rough draft to determine an overall
    percentage grade for the finished assignment. Any late penalties for
    the introductory paragraph, rough draft, and finished paper will all
    be deducted from the mark at this time. For how percentage marks
    correspond with letter grades in English courses, see this
    page.

-   Your TL may not provide any written feedback or only a very small
    amount along with the percentage mark. However, you are welcome to
    talk with your TL in person about the mark for the finished paper,
    should you want advice on improving your writing in future courses,
    just as you are welcome to talk with them at earlier points in the
    process!
