description: I have approached the use of GenAI as something my students need to know so that they can form their own impressions based on having tried it and not align themselves with many opinion pieces in the literature. I have aspired for students to try the GenAI to produce the first draft and then see the limitations in prompts, in the output, the gaps, and then fill them in. This way, they would witness the strengths and limitations of GenAI (at least partially).

**Use of Generative AI (GenAI)**: You are encouraged to use GenAI tools, like ChatGPT,
to assist with this assignment. This can be for brainstorming ideas, structuring your paper,
or even drafting content.\
**Submission Components**: You must submit the following:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prompt you provided to the AI.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The output produced by the AI.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your final edited paper.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Note: Each of these components should start on a separate page. And use
subheadings.*\

and why it resonates with you personally. This section allows you to inject your personal
perspective into the paper. Avoid being generic.\
**Body and Conclusion**: The remainder of the paper should maintain an objective tone.
This means avoiding the use of first-person pronouns (e.g., "I", "we"). Your name should
only appear on the title page.\
**Originality**: While you are permitted to use GenAI for assistance, the final paper should
be your original work. Any direct excerpts from the AI's output should be properly cited.
Please see the citation conventions for AI work.\
**Research and Credibility**: You are to support your claims by researching credible
academic sources and citing them properly. Credible academic sources are defined as
refereed journal articles and credible books (not gray references). Ensure that you
integrate these sources effectively to bolster your arguments.\
