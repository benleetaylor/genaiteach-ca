generative AI technology such as ChatGPT. You may use any text
generative AI program you want. ChatGPT-3 is available for free. You
will come up with a specific prompt related to course concepts about
primates, hominins, or Neanderthals and submit it to a generative AI
program. You will then evaluate the AI's answer in your own reflection
response that must be written without the aid of AI. Using AI to
generate your reflection response will be considered Academic
Dishonesty."

**Reflection 2 -- Can ChatGPT Teach Evolution (30 pts)**

**Instructions**: Download, fill-in, and submit this form. You
must maintain this document's 1-inch margins, single-spacing, and 12pt
font. Take note of the expected length given for each section.

For this reflection, you will critically evaluate responses from
generative AI technology such as ChatGPT. You may use any text
generative AI program you want. ChatGPT-3 is available for free. You
will come up with a specific prompt related to course concepts about
primates, hominins, or Neanderthals and submit it to a generative AI
program. You will then evaluate the AI's answer in your own reflection
response that must be written without the aid of AI. Using AI to
generate your reflection response will be considered Academic
Dishonesty. Â 

**Recommendations for writing a prompt.** Ask the AI a question that
makes it have to reflect, discuss, explain, or synthesize some
information. Don't ask yes or no questions. Find a topic that interests
you that we have discussed in class for Unit 2. Make sure your prompt is
specific but you want to get it to generate a response that gives you
something to analyze or assess. If you ask a prompt that just generates
facts you are going to have a hard time evaluating. Consider asking it a
question that is controversial or get creative. Feed it other material
and ask it to evaluate it. Tell it how long you want the response to be.
Aim for 2-3 paragraphs so you have enough material to assess the
response. You may need to try several different prompts and refine your
question to get something good.

**Prompt examples** (these are covering Unit 1 material)

-   "ChatGPT, can you explain how a population bottleneck impacts
    genetic diversity and provide a specific example?"
-   "Hello AI, write a 300 word essay on how Charles Darwin's
    observations while on the Beagle influenced his theory of Natural
    selection"
-   Copy and paste the transcript of the podcast "Mendel's Trick" and
    ask ChatGPT to evaluate the content from the point of view of
    Charles Darwin.
-   Ask it to be creative:
    -   "ChatGPT, can you come up with a scientific study that
        challenges the biological species concept?"
    -   \"If Charles Darwin had access to modern technology, how do you
        think he would have documented and communicated his findings on
        evolution? Describe the social media posts or multimedia content
        he might create.\"

**Your 200-400 word assessment should include:**

1.  An evaluation of the AI response:
    -   Is the response fully truthful? Are there any inaccuracies? Is
        there any bias in the answer? If there is bias, who might
        disagree with what the AI said?
    -   What are the strengths and weaknesses of the AI's response?
    -   Does the AI's response align with what we have learned in class?
    -   Reflect on the role of AI in enhancing or challenging our
        understanding of evolutionary thought.
    -   You don't have to answer every one of these questions.
2.  Your opinion of using AI:
    -   Do you think AI can be used to teach complex concepts such as we
        cover in class? Explain your answer.
    -   Consider the implications of using generative AI platforms in
        academic and scientific research.
