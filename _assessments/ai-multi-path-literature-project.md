### AI Project

#### Instructions updated and remixed March 14, 2023 with ChatGPT (GPT-4 model!!)

All tools discussed are either completely free or have a free version.
Don't pay for anything; use what is free. I recommend getting a gmail
account to log into and use these tools.

The assignment is worth 10% of your final grade. More topics will be
added.

Choose one of the AI paths, then one of the topic options.

#### AI Path 1: Creative Writing Exploration in Literature

Objective: To encourage students to engage with literary works through
creative reinterpretation, experimentation with different genres, and
collaboration with AI language models.

Instructions: Choose ONE of the following four prompts for your
assignment. You will use an AI language model, such as ChatGPT or Bing
AI, to assist in generating ideas, rewriting scenes, or crafting your
story. Make sure to screenshot your prompts and include them in your
final submission. Your response should be approximately 500 words.


1.  Reinterpretation of a Scene:
    -   Select a chapter or scene from a literary work studied in the
        course.
    -   Use the AI language model to help you reimagine the scene in a
        different genre or tone (such as an action story, murder
        mystery, or Gothic style).
    -   Write a 500-word reinterpretation of the scene, incorporating
        elements from the new genre or tone.
2.  Alternative Ending:
    -   Choose a book from the course and identify a character or
        situation you\'d like to explore further (e.g., Tallulah getting
        revenge on Scarlett).
    -   Use the AI language model to generate ideas for an alternative
        ending or resolution for the selected character or situation.
    -   Write a 500-word alternative ending based on the ideas generated
        with the AI language model.
3.  Plot Summary and Scene Creation:
    -   Create a prompt for the AI language model to generate a plot
        summary for a story in any genre of your choice.
    -   Once you have the plot summary, decide whether you want to write
        the first two or final two pages of the story.
    -   Use the AI language model to help you craft the selected scene,
        incorporating elements from the plot summary and your own
        creativity.
4.  AI Co-Writing Experience:
    -   Choose a genre for a short story and begin writing it.
    -   As you progress, use the AI language model as a co-writer or
        writing partner by providing 10-15 creative prompts to generate
        ideas, dialogue, descriptions, or plot developments.
    -   Integrate the AI-generated content into your story, adapting it
        as necessary to maintain coherence and consistency.
    -   Write a 500-word short story that showcases your collaboration
        with the AI language model.

Remember to include screenshots of your prompts and the AI-generated
content as part of your submission. This will help demonstrate your
creative process and collaboration with the AI language model.


#### AI Path 2: AI-Assisted Paraphrasing in Literature

Objective: To explore the capabilities and limitations of AI language
models in paraphrasing literary quotes, and to analyze the results for
effectiveness and accuracy.

Instructions: Choose ONE of your quote posts, and use two different AI
rewriting tools (such as ChatGPT and Bing AI) to paraphrase the quote.
Compare and contrast the

original quote post and the AI-generated variations in a 500-word
analysis. Make sure to include screenshots of the original quote and the
AI-generated paraphrases as part of your submission.

Other tools include: Writemate.ai \| Wordtune Editor \| ParagraphAI (https://paragraphai.com/) \| Hyperwrite \| ComposeAI \| Moonbeam \| Any
other AI writing tool, Grammarly, etc.

1.  Select a quote:
    -   Choose a quote from a literary work studied in the course that
        is meaningful or significant.
2.  Use AI rewriting tools:
    -   Rewrite the quote using two different AI rewriting tools.
    -   Ensure that each tool paraphrases each sentence within the quote
        post.
    -   Take screenshots of the AI-generated paraphrases for your
        submission.
3.  Compare and contrast:
    -   In a 500-word analysis, discuss the similarities and differences
        between the original quote and the AI-generated paraphrases.
    -   Consider aspects such as meaning, tone, style, and accuracy.
4.  Evaluate the results:
    -   In your analysis, address whether the AI-generated paraphrases
        led to interesting or uninteresting results.
    -   Discuss the implications of using AI language models for
        paraphrasing in literature, considering both their potential
        benefits and limitations.

Submission Requirements:
-   Include the original quote and screenshots of the AI-generated
    paraphrases.
-   Provide a 500-word analysis comparing and contrasting the original
    quote and the AI-generated variations.
-   Discuss the effectiveness and accuracy of the AI-generated
    paraphrases and their impact on your interpretation of the quote.

By completing this assignment, you will gain insights into the
capabilities of AI language models in the context of literary analysis
and develop a deeper understanding of the nuances of paraphrasing in
literature.


#### AI Path 3: Visual Storytelling through AI-Generated Images

Objective: To engage with literary works by using AI-generated images
for visual storytelling, exploring creative reinterpretation, and
merging storylines from different books.

Instructions: Choose ONE of the following two prompts for your
assignment. You will use an AI text-to-image tool (such as DALL-E) to
generate illustrations based on your prompts. Create at least 10 images
with a caption for each. Make sure to include screenshots of your
prompts and the AI-generated images in your final submission.

Other tools include: Lexica Aperature \| Playground AI \| Stable
Diffusion 2 \| Dall-E 2 \| Midjourney

1.  Comic Book/Illustrated Scene:
    -   Select a scene from one of the literary works studied in the
        course.
    -   Write 10 descriptive prompts that capture the key moments or
        elements of the scene, which will serve as the basis for your
        AI-generated images.
    -   Use the AI text-to-image tool to create an illustration for each
        prompt.
    -   Write a caption for each image to provide context and narrative.

        a new, merged storyline.
    -   Write 10 prompts that blend the storylines and serve as the
        basis for your AI-generated images.
    -   Use the AI text-to-image tool to create an illustration for each
        prompt.
    -   Write a caption for each image that helps tell the new, merged
        story.
    -   Compile the images and captions to create a visually engaging
        narrative that combines the selected literary works.

Submission Requirements:
-   Include screenshots of your prompts and the AI-generated images.
-   Provide a caption for each of the 10 images.
-   Compile the images and captions into either a comic book/illustrated
    scene (for Prompt 1) or a merged storyline (for Prompt 2).
