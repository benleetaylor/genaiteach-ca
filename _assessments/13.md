title: "Generative AI and ChatGPT: What Do They Know? Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out!"
author: Sean A. McPhail
institution: University of Windsor, McMaster University, University of Toronto Mississauga
discipline: English Language and Literature
description: "To complete this assignment, students ask ChatGPT to explain their novel's significance to World Literature. When testing the AI, I found that it regularly gave very simple answers that spoke to (what we could broadly classify) each novel's depiction of colonialism, its narrative, and its use of language. These terms have more than one possible definition in our discipline, and so the assignment allows students to interpret them how they please and build their own answers off the AI's suggestion."

Select one of the novels on the course syllabus (i.e. Soyinka, Rhys, or
Coetzee). Then, type the following into ChatGPT: "Write a 5-6 sentence
paragraph explaining the importance of **\[AUTHOR\]**'s **\[TEXT
TITLE\]** to World Literature in English." Copy and paste the response
verbatim into your word document. You do not need to cite the AI, but do
include headings so your grader knows where the generated response ends
and your writing begins.

Next, in 750 words, construct an argument in response to the
AI-generated answer. For example, if you think that it is persuasive,
articulate what it does well. If it isn't compelling, make a case for
why not. If it's a mixed bag, articulate this. Whatever your take, your
response should respond to the AI's discussion (or lack thereof) of
**colonialism**, **narrative**, and **language**. In **each** case, make
sure you include at least one textual example from the novel in question
to support your position. You are welcome to use secondary sources to
support your argument, but this is not required.
