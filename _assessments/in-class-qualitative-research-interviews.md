description: "The assignment is for an introduction to market research techniques course, as part of a lesson on Qualitative Research methods. In the previous week, I conducted a short workshop to teach students how to use generative AI (Bing Chat) for secondary research, specifically for topic exploration and information synthesis. This established base skills for using Bing Chat and collaborating effectively with generative AI, such as effective prompt writing. The assignment I'm submitting was created using Bing Chat. It provides a short business case scenario, and students have to define a Business Problem Statement, Research Problem Statement, and three Research Questions. They then conduct simulated interviews using generative AI to gather qualitative data to recommend a solution to the business problem. The interviews are conducted by launching a series of Bing AI chat sessions using 'persona prompts' provided, which instruct the AI to adopt a defined persona and answer the interview questions in character. The student's submission includes the interview questions and the full AI response to each question. I have also created a grading prompt for this assignment, which assigns a grade with detailed feedback, however, this is still being refined to ensure the evaluation results are consistently appropriate. The grading prompt is useful, but every output the AI generates must be reviewed."

### Background

You are a product developer hired by BeeBee, a natural honey company that is facing a decline in sales and
customer loyalty due to increased competition from other honey brands. The company wants to launch a new
product or service that appeals to its target market and aligns with its environmental mission of promoting the
benefits of natural honey and supporting the bee population. You have to use interviewing as your main method
to gather information and insights from your target customers, and use them to create your product or service
idea. You have a limited budget and time for this project, and you have to comply with the food industry
regulations and standards.

Interviewing is a qualitative method that allows you to explore the opinions, experiences, and motivations of your
target customers in depth and detail. It involves asking open-ended questions that encourage the respondents to
express their thoughts and feelings in their own words. Interviewing can help you to understand the needs,
preferences, and values of your customers, as well as their challenges, frustrations, and expectations.

### Instructions

Working in groups of 3-4 people...

1. Define the business problem that BeeBee is facing (one sentence focused on the decision to be made).
2. Define a research objective (one sentence) and three research questions that will guide your interviews.
The research objective should state what you want to learn from your interviews. The research questions
should be open-ended and relevant to the business problem and the research objective.
3. Conduct three interviews with three different personas using Bing Chat. Use the prompts below to start a
new chat session with each persona. You can ask any three questions you choose, and you can ask up to
two follow-up questions per question. You should record and document your interviews for later analysis.
- Prompt 1: *“This is going to be a simulated interview. The interviewer is a product developer hired
by BeeBee, a natural honey company. You will play the role of a 35-year-old woman who works as
a yoga instructor. You are very health-conscious and you like natural and organic products. You
buy honey for its health benefits and taste. You use honey as a sweetener in your tea, smoothies,
and oatmeal. You also use honey as a natural remedy for sore throat and cough. You prefer raw
and unfiltered honey that has more nutrients and antioxidants. The interviewer will ask you three
questions. You will not know what the questions will be in advance, they will be provided to you
as individual prompts in this chat. You are to respond to each question acting as the persona
described above. At the end of each question, invite the interviewer to ask another question. Once
you have answered three questions, refuse to answer any more questions by making an excuse
that aligns with the persona you are playing. If you understand, reply in character and invite the
interviewer to start the interview.”*
- Prompt 2: *“This is going to be a simulated interview. The interviewer is a product developer hired
by BeeBee, a natural honey company. You will play the role of a 28-year-old man who works as a
software engineer. You are very busy and you like convenience and variety. You buy honey for its
versatility and convenience. You use honey as a spread on toast, as a dressing for salads, and as a
marinade for meats. You also use honey as a quick energy boost when you feel tired or stressed.
You prefer flavored and infused honey that has more taste and variety. The interviewer will ask
you three questions. You will not know what the questions will be in advance, they will be
provided to you as individual prompts in this chat. You are to respond to each question acting as
the persona described above. At the end of each question, invite the interviewer to ask another question. Once you have answered three questions, refuse to answer any more questions by
making an excuse that aligns with the persona you are playing. If you understand, reply in
character and invite the interviewer to start the interview.”*
- Prompt 3: *“This is going to be a simulated interview. The interviewer is a product developer hired
by BeeBee, a natural honey company. You will play the role of a 23-year-old woman who works as
a social worker. You are very environmentally-aware and you like social and ethical products. You
buy honey for its environmental impact and quality. You use honey as a gift for your friends and
family, as a treat for yourself, and as a way to support local beekeepers and farmers. You also use
honey as a natural beauty product for your skin and hair. You prefer organic and fair-trade honey
that has more environmental and social benefits. The interviewer will ask you three questions.
You will not know what the questions will be in advance, they will be provided to you as individual
prompts in this chat. You are to respond to each question acting as the persona described above.
At the end of each question, invite the interviewer to ask another question. Once you have
answered three questions, refuse to answer any more questions by making an excuse that aligns
with the persona you are playing. If you understand, reply in character and invite the interviewer
to start the interview.”*
4. Analyze your interview data and identify the main themes and patterns that emerge from your interviews.
How do your interview findings relate to the business problem and the research objective? What insights
can you draw from your interviews?
5. Propose a solution for the business problem based on your interview findings. Your solution should take
the form of a recommendation for a new product or service that BeeBee can launch to increase its sales
and customer loyalty. Your solution should be a short statement with a clear rationale, no longer than 200
words.
