description:  I have submitted 2 module quiz essay questions. One question requires the use of AI to generate the answer in the timeframe allotted and the other essay question gives students an AI generated answer that they need to fix. The students will have practiced similar questions during in-class activities so that they can identify that Generative AI is useful but not perfect. They still need to do their own critical thinking. Students tend to use ChatGPT or Perplexity in my classes. Each of the example questions are from a pool of similar questions but with different scenarios.

**QUIZ EXAMPLE**

Welcome to the quiz for Module 4. 

You must demonstrate competence in applying the concept of strategic
planning and performance management to a company. It is expected that
before you begin the quiz you have completed the learning activities in
Modules 1-3. 

You will have 120 minutes to complete each essay question. 

Your answer must reflect your own abilities and you may not receive help
from a human during your quiz. You are expected to give your best answer
and an incomplete attempt will not receive credit. 

***Acknowledgement of AI tools Usage.** You may use AI to help you in
the process of completing the assignments in this course but if you
submit the AI output as your own work, then it is considered Academic
Misconduct. You are also responsible to verify all the outputs.*

*Acting with integrity means that if you use any AI tools for either the
idea generation (e.g. ChatGPT) or to improve your writing (e.g. a
paraphrasing tool like Quilbot) then you should be transparent about
what AI you used and how. This transparency will allow us to evolve the
conversation about ethics and integrity expectations for class and
industry.*

*Include this acknowledgement with your references.*

Quizzes in this course will not be graded in the typical \"point\"
fashion. Instead, each essay question in the quiz will be graded on a
competence demonstrated/failure as outlined below.

10/10 = Demonstrates competence. Excellent. Answers all parts of the
question accurately. Clear communication shows competence with this
topic at first reading. Includes references. Shows you would be able to
use this skill with minimal supervision in the workplace.

7/10 = Meets expectations of basic competence. \"Good faith\" attempt at
all parts of the question but additional guidance would be needed to be
able to meet expectations in the workplace. Includes references.

0/10 = Does not demonstrate competence.  Partial understanding is
evident but significant gaps remain. Would not be able to complete this
assignment independently in the workplace. Needs better communication.
Additional reading and module review is required. (You may redeem a
token to resubmit after you have reviewed the topic and instructor
feedback, if no second attempt is made then it is a 0% grade.)

**Question 1:**

ChatGPT4 has created the balanced scorecard for Tim Horton\'s. However,
the CEO is highly skeptical that an AI tool can understand the vision
and values of the company. Your task as the business analyst is to
carefully examine each goal to make sure it aligns with the strategy of
the company. You must use information found on the official company
website and any reports (e.g. Annual Report) published by the company.

Submit the following in your answer:

1.  Revised SMART goals in each section with an explanation of why each
    edit was necessary based on specific company data you found. If no
    revisions are necessary, then explain which data supports the AI
    generated goal. Provide links to the specific data.
2.  Pick one of the goals and explain how you think the manager
    responsible for that goal should keep track of progress between now
    and the deadline. Be as practical as possible.

ChatGPT4 created goals:

- Financial Perspective: Increase franchise revenue by 8% within the three
fiscal years by expanding into untapped markets.\
- Customer Perspective: Enhance drive-thru experience and satisfaction by
10% over the next year through implementing an improved ordering system.\
- Internal Process Perspective: Reduce food waste by 20% within the next
18 months through accurate demand forecasting.\
- Learning and Growth Perspective: Improve leadership development scores
by 12% over the next fiscal year through a comprehensive management
training program.

**Question 2:**

**Academic Integrity**,

**Question 4**

Food Truck Business

*You are expected to use AI to help you generate your answer or you
won\'t finish in time. However, you are responsible to make sure the
answer is accurate and matches the course material since it a reflection
of your competence. AI doesn\'t know exactly how the topics were covered
in this course so you need to guide AI in the chat. Also, you will need
to verify information to make sure it\'s logical for the particular size
and scope of the business. The scenario is based in Calgary.*

**Scenario\*:**

Peter, a highly skilled chef, has spent the better part of his career
dazzling patrons at high-end restaurants across the city. He has
mastered the art of blending flavours and presenting them in a manner
that delights both the eyes and the palate. Now, Peter dreams of a
venture that will bring gourmet cuisine out of the confines of plush
restaurants and into everyday life. He envisions launching a food truck
business that combines culinary sophistication with the affordability
and accessibility of street food. As part of his business planning
process, he aims to create a Business Model Canvas to map out the key
elements of his business.

He only has access to \$150,000 to begin so he will keep it small to
start but he needs to generate a profit quickly.

**Task:**

Your task is to assist Peter in creating a comprehensive Business Model
Canvas for his food truck business. For each of the nine components
provide an appropriate answer and explain why you made those choices.
For example, you can write his value proposition and explain how it
matches his vision or mission statement. You would also include the
statement.

Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the individual
elements of the business model canvas and how they interrelate. In your
explanations, make sure you show that you include any details that are
relevant to the strategic planning process but might not be explicit in
the business model canvas.

**Submission Requirements**:

1.  Completed Business Model Canvas. Upload a completed template (typed
    or a photo of a handwritten one).
2.  Explanations for each element to show that the choices were
    strategic. Make sure you include the topics covered in Modules 1-3
    and in-class. Each explanation should be one paragraph or less.
3.  Which information from the strategic planning process do you think
    is still missing? Explain how important you think it is to get these
    decisions made before launching the business.
4.  List all AI tools that you used and how you used them.
